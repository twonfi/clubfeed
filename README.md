# ClubFeed: A reusable web app to see what's up with your community
## What is ClubFeed?
**ClubFeed** is a mix between social media's club communication usage, the simplicity of other communication apps,
and forums' grouping of posts.

Once the ClubFeed admin sets up clubs, club owners and posters can post to them and anyone can follow clubs to see them
on their own ClubFeed.

## What does it use?
ClubFeed uses the _Django_ web framework, which is powered by _Python_.

## How do I set it up?
Take a look at `INSTALL.md`.

***

## Code contributions/patches?
I still need to figure some things out, like if to use the GNU AGPL instead (some libraries are AGPL).
I'll try to be nice and not require you to sign a CLA, but don't waste time writing patches for now.
In the meantime, file an issue and I might be able to implement it by writing my own code.
